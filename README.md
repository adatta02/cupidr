# Cupidr!

When's the last time you got a piece of snail mail? Exactly. This web app changes that and so much more (not really).  Shipped with sixteen beautiful movie related 
templates, Cupidr lets you send a postcard via the Lob.com API to anyone in the USA!

It's built on Silex and also includes a fun background video!
